# check_number
I built this code through the use of a function, check_number(num), where we cast the user input into an integer and checked whether the input was odd or even via the modulus operator. I made a try-except block available in order to tackle bad input and output the respective error message. Last, but not least, I solicited user input and inputed this into the function and returned this.
